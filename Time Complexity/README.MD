-   Time Complexity is the language and metric for measuring the <b>performance/efficiency</b> of algorithms.

-   There are many Runtime to be defined, but most common ones are O(logN), O(N), O(NlogN), O(N^2), O(2^N), O(N!) etc.

-   <b><u><i>Big O:</i></u></b> It is the upper bound of the runtime of an algorithm. It is the worst case scenario. It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is very large.

        AlogTime <= UpperBound

-   <b><u><i>Big Omega:</i></u></b> It is the lower bound of the runtime of an algorithm. It is the best case scenario. It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is very small.

        AlogTime >= LowerBound

-   <b><u><i>Big Theta:</i></u></b> It is the tight bound of the runtime of an algorithm. It is the average case scenario. It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is medium.

        LowerBound <= AlogTime <= UpperBound

-   Best Case, Worst Case and Average Case are the three scenarios for the runtime of an algorithm.

-   <b><u><i>Best Case:</i></u></b> It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is very small.

-   <b><u><i>Worst Case:</i></u></b> It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is very large.

-   <b><u><i>Average Case:</i></u></b> It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is medium.

-   <b><u><i>Amortized Analysis:</i></u></b> It is the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is very large and the algorithm is called multiple times.

-   <b><u><i>Space Complexity:</i></u></b> It is the language and metric for measuring the <b>memory</b> used by an algorithm.

-   <b><u><i>Linear Time:</i></u></b> When the algorithm takes time equal to the input size.

        AlogTime = N

-   <b><u><i>Logarithmic Time:</i></u></b> When the algorithm takes time equal to the log of the input size.

         AlogTime = logN

-   <b><u><i>Recursive Time:</i></u></b>
